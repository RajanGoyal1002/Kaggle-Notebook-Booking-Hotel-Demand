# Hotel Booking Demand
## Description
When a customer book a city hotel or resort, he or she will look at various various factors such duration and time of booking to get the best price, before the confirmation of booking.  
I analyzed the hotel booking demand dataset using logistic regression to predict whether a customer will confirm the booking or not based on following features:

1. Hotel (H1 = Resort Hotel or H2 = City Hotel)
2. Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date
3. Year of arrival date
4. Month of arrival date
5. Week number of year for arrival date
6. Day of arrival date
7. Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel
8. Number of week nights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel
9. Number of adults
